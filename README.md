# Computer Science I/II/III
* Computer Science I talks about basic programming concepts. It covers fundamental principles of computer science and software engineering concepts, includes requirement analysis, design, implement, and test of software; introduces programming in a structured high-level language. It provides significant hands-on experiences with programming using a integrated development environment and computer operating system. 
* Computer Science II talks about basic data structures. It covers recursion, abstract data types, classes, and object oriented programming. It includes implementations, as abstract data types, of the data structures stacks, queues, linked lists, and binary trees.  It also covers standard libraries and applications of these data structures. 
* Computer Science III talks about advanced data structures, algorithms, object orientation, and standard libraries with an emphasis on practical programming.
